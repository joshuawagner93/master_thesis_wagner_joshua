practical part:
 - machine learning models:
  - random forest
  - gradient boosting classifier
 - cnn
 - rnn (single shot, predict everything at once)
 - residual nets
 - ar rnn (output back as input)
 
wavelet:
 - CNN on the spectrogramm from the continous-wavelet-transformation
 - different features extrated through discrete-wavelet-transformation
  - usefull for different classification models
 - DWT to smooth the timeseries before feeding it to a RNN etc.
 - DWT, then run an RNN on the different timeseries and then run the inverse on the prediction
 

dataset: (maybe)
 - M series competition
 - HAR dataset
