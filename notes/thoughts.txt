har feature extraction:
  - use features based on dwt subbands
  - less features as the tsfresh extraction takes ~6 hours with subbands
  - without subbands use the tsfresh features, more features but no dwt splitting
  - one run with the original features

prediction/forecasting:
  - baseline arima model
  - Using wavelets for time series forecasting: Does it pay off? 
    :- sub-band analysis - each band gets predicted
  - Comparison of deep learning models for multivariate prediction of time series wind power generation and temperature
    :- sub-band and fft prediction, inversion of predicted coefficients
  - Combining the Real-Time Wavelet Denoising and Long-Short-Term-Memory Neural Network for Predicting Stock Indexes
    :- sub-band denoising, no inverse transformation, model train with denoised data
  - An Empirical Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Time Series Forecasting
    :- CART, MLP, KNN, SVR for prediction

results:
  - explorative analysis if the "bad" models classify the same easy to classify data and don't perform on the bad data or if they are just worse
